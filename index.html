        <h1>GHC's Summer Underwear and Sock Drive</h1>
        <p>We are hoping to achieve two ends - 1) to restock our supply of gently used clothing, underwear and socks for emergency purposes during the school day and 2) to stock the resource space with new clothing, underwear and socks for families to take and keep when needed.</p>
        <p>Would GHC be interested in holding a drive for the following items?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Socks (Youth sizes, New only)</li>
            <li>Underwear (4T-16/18, New only)</li>
            <li>New or gently used clothing (long and short sleeve shirts, sweatshirts, pants, shorts) in sizes 4T-16/18</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Details:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When:</strong> July 5th - July 19th</li>
            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Drop off at any GHC clinic</li>
            <li><strong>What:</strong> New underwear and socks (all sizes needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's help every student start the school year off right!</p>
